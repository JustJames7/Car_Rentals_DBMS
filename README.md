# Car_Rentals_DBMS

## Project Overview
Car rentals offer a convenient solution for customers requiring temporary transportation. This project presents a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) for managing a car rental business. The system enables customers to rent vehicles by creating an account, selecting from a variety of fleet options, and choosing a rental period. Payment options include full payment or a minimum fee, ensuring flexibility for customers. Additionally, the system tracks essential information such as vehicle usage, transactions, and customer attributes to maintain operational efficiency and transparency.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient database system to manage car rental operations. The system aims to:
- Provide customers with a seamless vehicle selection and rental process.
- Maintain detailed records of customer accounts, transactions, and vehicle rentals.
- Ensure secure and trustworthy operations by tracking insurance codes, credit scores, and payment history.
- Streamline administrative tasks such as mileage tracking, payment adjustments, and fleet management.
